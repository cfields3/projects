# Christopher's Relias Project Portfolio

### Welcome to my project repository!
This repository contains a collection of recent software projects I have worked on.

## Repository Structure
I have divided this repository into directories based on different projects I have worked on.

My most recent projects that I am particularly proud of are contained within the Howler & PackProducer directories. Howler is a prototype version of a social media application, similar to Twitter, in which information for users are stored within MySQL. This project was built using Node.js, Express, JavaScript/HTML/CSS and is a web application. Similarly, PackProducer was made using some of the same tecnologies, but is stored and run through a Docker container. PackProducer is a "Looking For Group" type application that allows you to make posts for different events you might be looking for others to join you at and others can respond and communicate about that event. Both applications include basic user authenication using hashing, RESTful APIs, and MySQL/MariaDB databases.

Java-Projects contains large-scale course projects that I worked on in NC State University's Software Development Fundamentals course. This includes an application, WolfScheduler, which I worked on with a group of 3 in lab that simulated course scheuling, and two other similar projects in the Java lanaguage. I think that these projects particularly showcase some of the software development lifecycle oriented projects that I have worked on.

OS-Projects contains projects I worked on in NC State University's Concepts & Facilities of Operating Systems course. These were some of the large coding projects that we worked on in the course, highlighting the use of multiprocessing, threads, synchronization, CUDA programming, and more in C & Java.

C-Projects contains different projects I worked on in NC State University's C & Software Tools course. Though this is not all the work we did in the course, I am highlighting some of the main projects that I worked on. In these projects, I worked with lots of facets of the C programming languages, as well as some other tools including Makefiles, valgrind, and more.
